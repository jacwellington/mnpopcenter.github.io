* **Hometown:** Born and raised in Minneapolis, MN
* **Favorite Dev Tool:** gdb
* **Fun Fact:** I make my own maple syrup! I just tap 2-3 trees/year, one in my back yard and a couple others near where I live.

**What brought you to your current professional field and eventually to the MPC?**

I took a high school computer programming class in 1966. We had one computer for the class to share.  It had a paper tape reader for input, an electric typewriter for output, no disk drives of any kind, it's dimensions were about 3' x 4' x 15", and it had probably 100+ circuit boards. It had 512 15-bit words of (real core!) memory. Needless to say, it didn't have any compilers.  We programmed it in assembly & machine language. 

As for the MPC, I didn't want to completely retire but the company I was working for wasn't interested in having part timers.  MPC appealed to me because it offered schedule flexibility and would allow me to do other things I was interested in.

**You've been in the industry a long time.  What are some of the most significant trends that you've seen over your career?**  

Significant trends... the cost vs. power curve. My first PC with all the peripherals cost me over $5,000 in 1983.  Needless to say you get a lot more today for 1/10th the price and it fits in your pocket. Also the internet - compare using a 1,200 baud dial up modem connecting to a few bulletin boards maintained by hobbyists local to the TC area with what's available today on the web.  There is no comparison!

**What is the most exciting technology (for its time) that you've worked with, and what technology were you most happy to see go away?**

Most exciting technology was having a computer I didn't have to share with other users (that 1983 PC). I was happy to see punch cards and card readers, sorters, collators, etc... go away.  Tape drives would be a close second.

**What’s the coolest thing you’ve gotten to work on at the MPC?**

dcp_multi [Ed. note: a parallelized version of our Data Conversion Program which produces our microdata for dissemination].  It also happens to be the only thing I've worked on at the MPC.

**When you’re not wrangling data at the MPC, what other things keep you busy?**

Volunteering with the City of Lakes Luminary Loppet, baking sourdough breads, tutoring recent immigrants at the Franklin Library Learning Center, and human powered outdoor activities such as cross-country skiing, biking and hiking.

**How do you get to work?**

By bike or on foot - only a 15 minute walk from home!

**What new skill(s) are your currently trying to learn?**

How to get this *&%#$ Mac to do what I want it to!
