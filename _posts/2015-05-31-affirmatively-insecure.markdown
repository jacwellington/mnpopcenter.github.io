author: gottreu
teaser: SHA-1 is on the way out and being helped through the door by Google.  Brian

I visited the doctor recently[^1] and on the paperwork they gave me when I left was an authorization code to register with their online medical records system. I visited the page to sign up and the address bar was distressingly decorated. ![HTTPS in strikethrough with a red X over a lock][img-insecure]

If I were using an older version of Chrome, it wouldn't look this scary. But I'm not, so it is. [Starting with version 42][L1], websites using certificates that both expire on or after 2017 and use SHA-1 for signatures are considered “affirmatively insecure” and rendered like the preceding image. Chrome considers SHA-1 certs that expire before 2017 as “secure, but with minor errors”. It renders it like so. ![Lock with yellow triangle][img-minor]

If you have a SHA-1[^2] cert that expires before 2016, either it will render as an ordinary secure site, or the cert is expired and the signature algorithm used is not the primary concern.

If you maintain websites you may wonder how you can check if your certificates use SHA-1 signatures. Halfway through writing a Perl script to do that check, I wondered that too and did a quick google search. The first result resulted in me thinking “oh yeah”, because it was [shaaaaaaaaaaaaa.com][L2], a creation of [Eric Mill][L3][^3], the man behind [isitchristmas.com][L4]. I'd visited sha{13}.com probably not that long after he [wrote about it][L5]. Even though I remembered to use one of his sites to verify the Christmasness of late December days, I had forgotten about this other all-season site.

Not only is there the [shaaaaaaaaaaaaa.com][L2] website where one can check if a domain uses a SHA-1 certificate, but there is also a command line `shaaaaaaaaaaaaa` tool. It's written in Node.js[^4], which I had never installed before. Luckily I do have homebrew installed on my Mac, so a quick `brew install node` was all that was needed for that prerequisite. Of course I already had Xcode and many other tools installed, so the process may not be as simple for you.

I grabbed a copy from github with
`git clone https://github.com/konklone/shaaaaaaaaaaaaa.git`,
and installed its dependencies with
`cd shaaaaaaaaaaaaa; npm install`.

I can check a single domain with `bin/shaaaaaaaaaaaaa nhgis.org`, and get the output of

```javascript
{
  "domain": "nhgis.org",
  "cert": {
    "algorithm": "sha256",
    "raw": "sha256WithRSAEncryption",
    "good": true,
    "root": false,
    "expires": "2018-04-26T23:59:59.000Z",
    "name": "nhgis.org"
  },
  "intermediates": [
    {
      "algorithm": "sha384",
      "raw": "sha384WithRSAEncryption",
      "good": true,
      "root": false,
      "expires": "2024-10-05T23:59:59.000Z",
      "name": "InCommon RSA Server CA"
    },
    {
      "algorithm": "sha384",
      "raw": "sha384WithRSAEncryption",
      "good": true,
      "root": false,
      "expires": "2020-05-30T10:48:38.000Z",
      "name": "USERTrust RSA Certification Authority"
    }
  ],
  "diagnosis": "good"
}
```

It gives the domain a diagnosis of "good", "bad", or "almost". A domain will get "almost" if the leaf cert uses SHA-2 but an intermediate cert still uses SHA-1.
I have a couple hundred domains to check, and assuming I have a file with one domain per line, then

```bash
cat domains.txt | xargs -P16 -L1 bin/shaaaaaaaaaaaaa > output.json 2> error.json
```

will do what I need. The `-L1` limits xargs to one domain per invocation of shaaaaaaaaaaaaa, and `-P16` will run up to 16 instances of shaaaaaaaaaaaaa in parallel.
Now I have a JSON document that says which domains use SHA-1 certs. I don't handle JSON all that often[^5], but I'd heard about <a href="http://stedolan.github.io/jq/">jq</a> and was able to install it with homebrew. On jq's homepage it reads "jq is like sed for JSON data". Because I'm a later generation Unix nerd, I first picked up Perl for data munging and never learned the difference between awk or sed, or how to use them. But the homepage also says that jq is a command line JSON processor that lets one filter and transform JSON.

To get only the domain name and diagnosis, I could do

```
jq '{domain: .domain, diag: .diagnosis}' output.json
```

To get back to the land of unstructured plain text, this would work

```
jq '"\(.domain) \(.diagnosis)"' output.json|sed -e 's/"//g'
```

All the SHA-1 certs should be replaced, but I want to prioritize those that might alarm users, so what I need to do is figure out which domains use SHA-1 certs that expire after Janurary 1, 2017.  At the MPC with the certificate authority we use, when SHA-2 certs are installed to replace SHA-1 certs, new SHA-2 intermediate certs are also installed, so I won't worry about intermediate certs right now, only leaf certs. To find the "affirmatively insecure" domains, I used:[^6]

```
cat output.json | jq 'select(.cert.expires >= "2017-01-01" and .cert.algorithm == "sha1") | .domain'
```

The output is a list of domains that recent versions of Chrome are complaining the most about and I can put those at the top of the certificate replacement list. I could do similar searches to find "secure, but with minor error" certs and the SHA-1 certs still considered secure.

I should point out that shaaaaaaaaaaaaa has a limited scope: determining if a domain has a certificate with SHA-1 signatures in its certificate chain. Though it does use [SNI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication) so you can check multiple domains hosted from a single IP, it does not check that the name on the cert actually matches the name specified. It also doesn't check that the cert isn't expired, that it's not self-signed, or that the server sends all the intermediate certs needed to verify that it's trusted by a root cert.[^8]

Perhaps if I avoid googling "tools to check certificate validity", I'll extend my Perl script to check for all those problems and write about it too.[^9]

[^1]: Do not worry, neither my lungs nor my posterior had been poisoned with poisonous gases.  Enjoy [some clips from a Flight of the Conchords episode][L6].
[^2]: While typing "a SHA-1", I realized that Google pronounces it as a single syllable followed by a number and not as three letters and a number.
[^3]: Eric Mill is also the only person that Snapchats with me. The stream is 90%+ cats and 100% delightful.
[^4]: I once had a discussion if it's “in Node” or “on Node”. I don't recall what the consensus was.
[^5]: Most of what I deal with is still plain text with whitespace delimiters. Also, get off my lawn.
[^6]: We're comparing the dates here as strings, but the dates are in ISO 8601 format, so it'll be fine as long as none of the expiration times use a non-UTC timezone. Pertinent: [xkcd.com/1179](https://xkcd.com/1179/) Also, complain about the [useless use of cat](http://www.smallo.ruhr.de/award.html) someplace else.
[^8]: Not to mention whether the server allows weak protocols or ciphers, or if it's vulnerable to Heartbleed, POODLE, FREAK, or Narnia.
[^9]: I could improve shaaaa to do those things, but 1) Mill doesn't wish to expand the scope of the tool, 2) all the Node SSL libraries I've checked seem to use the openssl command line tool and mangle its output rather than interface with the C library, 3) I'm more fluent in Perl than Javascript.
