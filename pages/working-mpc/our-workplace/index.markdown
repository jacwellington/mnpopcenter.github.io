Home base for the MPC IT Core is <a title="Willey Hall" href="http://www1.umn.edu/twincities/maps/WilleyH/" target="_blank">Willey Hall</a> on the West Bank of the Twin Cities campus of the University of Minnesota. With the Mississippi River and the sprawling East Bank campus just out our front door, and the Cedar-Riverside neighborhood and downtown Minneapolis out the back, we're in a convenient, beautiful, and connected spot. Our workspace balances collaboration with privacy, and campus offers lots of options for hiding away when focus time is needed.

### Our Office
We've worked hard to create a healthy and productive space, and you'll notice attention to details like ergonomic work areas and thoughtful tech in the conference rooms. Sometimes it's the little things that put a smile on our face, like taking a break on the comfy chairs in the lounge and watching the Green Line trains roll by, enjoying the Peace Coffee we brew in the kitchen, or wandering into a bounty of homegrown veggies that a co-worker has brought in to share.

### Our Community
Hang around our office long enough and you're bound to run into an interesting gathering. Maybe you want to satisfy your intellectual curiosity? Try our seminar series, with talks that highlight the impact of our work around the world. Hungry? Then our monthly summer BBQs, fall chili cookoff, or holiday party might be just the ticket. Had a long week of coding? Wind down with the team at our weekly Friday wrap-up. And while you're wandering through, be sure to check out the research posters and technical diagrams - we're fortunate to get to work with such a talented and smart group of folks, and the proof is hanging on our walls.
